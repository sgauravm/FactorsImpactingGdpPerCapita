# Social Factors impacting GDP per capita:

In this project we try to find out the importance of each of the social factors in determining the GDP per capita of a country. For this purpose we have chosen the following social factors :

1. Literacy
2. Percentage of urban population under slum
3. Percentage of people earning less than $1.3 per day
4. Corruption
5. Government Effectiveness
6. Political Stability
7. Adult Mortality

We will be using linear regression with the above features as explanatory variable and GDP per capita as dependent variable. Using this model we will try to infer the importance of these features relative to one another.
